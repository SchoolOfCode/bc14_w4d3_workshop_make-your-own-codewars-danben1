Title: Sum of Two Lowest Numbers

Description:
Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum
of the two lowest numbers in the array. Your task is to implement a function that 
finds the two smallest numbers in the array and returns their sum.

Input:
An array of numbers (length >= 2) where each element may be positive or negative and an integer or float.

Output:
A single number, representing the sum of the two lowest numbers in the input array.

Example:
Positive Integers Input
sumOfTwoLowestNumbers([5, 8, 12, 3, 9]); // Output: 8
Negative Float Input
sumOfTwoLowestNumbers([-0.5, -2.1, -1.3, -7.8, -11.4, -5.9]); // Output: -19.2

Note:
The input array will always have at least two elements.
The input array may contain duplicate numbers.
The input array may not be sorted.
The output should be the sum of the two lowest numbers in the array, regardless of their order in the input array.
